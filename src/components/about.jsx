          I am a graduating MBA student at Carnegie Mellon University&apos;s
          Tepper School of Business - passionate about using my engineering
          skills and my past experiences in creating tech products. I love to
          build products that tap into data to drive a meaningful and impactful
          change in the world while putting a smile on our customers&apos;
          faces.

          I started my career as a software engineer at a small startup in
          Silicon Valley, building web and mobile apps using the latest
          technologies such as EmberJS and React. I was part of a team that
          built an online ordering app from scratch using React, Redux, and
          NodeJS. Working at a startup allowed me to work with all divisions of
          the company and get a deeper understanding of how they think and what
          they want in a solution. I have worked as a Product Manager in an
          industry that did not fully utilize technology. In this role, I was
          tasked to create a product for our customers that had not used
          technology before. One of my biggest lessons was on gaining trust. I
          had to learn to take risks and work with a compromise to gain our
          customers&apos; trust before I could showcase the power of technology.
          Over the summer I worked at HP Inc., on a couple of projects. One that
          was creating a strategy to increase HPâ€™s revenue globally across 3
          verticals and another improving one of their hardware products. Both
          projects had me performing customer research to understand their pain
          points, researching data, brainstorming solutions, gaining buy-in from
          key stakeholders, and finally proposing a solution.

          I am passionate about interacting with customers to uncover their
          problems, discovering a strategy to solve these problems, working
          closely with engineers and designers to build a solution and iterating
          and testing until we reach a minimum viable product.
